# Sales and Profit Dashboard – MySQL Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of designing a relational database, importing and cleaning data, writing analytical SQL queries, and generating meaningful business insights from raw data.  

The dataset simulates over **1,000 sales transactions** for a fictional electronics retailer, **TechMart**, covering a one-year period. It includes data on product sales, revenue, profit, discounts, sales channels, and regions.

The primary goal of this project is to show how MySQL can be used to transform raw data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.

   - Used query results to build clear, business-focused visualisations.
